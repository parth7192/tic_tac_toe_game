# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Flutter. This project is a basic implementation of the classic two-player game where each player alternates turns to mark either an "X" or an "O" on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to place three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## Features

- **Turn-based gameplay**: Two players can take turns tapping on the grid to place their mark (X or O).
- **Win detection**: Automatically detects a win or a draw after each move.
- **Reset functionality**: Players can reset the game at any time.
- **Responsive design**: The game UI adapts to different screen sizes.
